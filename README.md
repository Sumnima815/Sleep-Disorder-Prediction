Sleep Disorder Prediction
This project aims to identify and predict sleep disorders using machine learning techniques. The model analyzes key sleep-related features to help classify potential sleep disorders.

Project Overview
Goal: Predict the likelihood of different sleep disorders
Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, scikit-learn
Algorithms: Machine Learning classifiers (e.g.Decision Tree, Random Forest)

The project results provide insights into the modelâ€™s accuracy and key predictors of sleep disorders.
